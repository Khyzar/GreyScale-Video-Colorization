////Steps to setup the code\\\\
1. First place the matlab code in me default directory i.e in documents folder where matlab files are.
2. Create a folder with name "New folder (4)" in E: directory in which the results are stored as i have also named it as in code so thats why. You can change the directory of the result folder in VCT.m file and VideoJoiner.m file. In visual studio change the name in form3.cs file.
3. After doing this the code is ready to rock and roll. If it gives some dlls error i have attached some dll files for that error.
